This is a repository for my projects for CS 312: Algorithm Design and Analysis.  
Project 1 - RSA key pair generation  
Project 2 - Find the convex hull of a 2d cluster of points using a recursive divide and conquer algorithm  
Project 3 - Find the least cost path given a start and end point in a 2d graph of points  
Project 4 - Use dynamic programming to find the minimum number of operations to convert one gene sequence to another
